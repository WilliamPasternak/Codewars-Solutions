Is my friend cheating?

A friend of mine takes the sequence of all numbers from 1 to n (where n > 0).
Within that sequence, he chooses two numbers, a and b.
He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, excluding a and b.
Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?

function removeNb (n) {
  let results = [];
  for (let a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
    let b = (n * (n + 1) / 2 - a) / (a + 1);
    if (b % 1 === 0 && b <= n) results.push([a, b]);
  }
  return results;
}
