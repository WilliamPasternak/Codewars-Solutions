Don't give me five!
In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

function dontGiveMeFive(start, end){
  let res = [];
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (!i.toString().includes('5')) res.push(i);
  }
  return res.length;
}
